# Anui
Anui - A Nice User Interface
This is a project I am working on in my free time because I thought it would be fun
and a good learning experience.

# What is Anui?
Anui is a C++ based GUI library. It chooses the OS/API to use at compile time.
- For Windows: uses WIN32
- For Linux: X11 / XCB
// One day if I ever have a apple anything but I probably won't - For Apple: Cacoa

# Getting started
Wait until the project is actually functional
